# Story-telling-with-Iris-Dataset
A machine learning Solution and EDA for Iris Dataset


The Iris dataset is one of the most explained and easy-to-use datasets available for beginners to explore machine learning. We know that to draw in recruiters, we must find solutions to new challenges. Then why is it important to solve that again, knowing it’s a very small dataset with already clean data? It's because the important aspect is not always how you solve a problem; it's how you narrate the solution, i.e., the art of storytelling with the data and conclusions obtained.

So, in this article, I am going to dive into the Iris dataset again. But this time I’m going to focus on creating a compelling story with Iris Flowers instead of just predicting the results.
